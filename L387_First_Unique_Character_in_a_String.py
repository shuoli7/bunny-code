# Input:
# A string

# Output:
# An integer, which represents the index of first non-repeating char in the string.

# Solution1 (hashmap)
# To solve this problem, we use a dictionary to help implementation.

# Loop over the string,
# I will set each character as the key and its frequency of appearance as value.

# After iteration, I loop over string again using index.
# In each round, I will check if the value for that character in dict is 1.
# If value is 1, we return that index.
# If at the end we still didn't find a key with value 1 in dict, we return -1.

# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)

# Solution2 (unicode)
# To solve this problem, we create a list with length of 26.

# The index of this list represents the unicode distance from current char to 'a',
# The value of this list represents the frequency of appearance at each position.

# Loop over the string, compute the unicode distance, 
# and increment the value at that position by 1.

# Loop over the string again, if we find value is 1 at certain position, 
# we return the index immediately.

# If at the end, we don't find a position with value 1. We return -1.

# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1) # If only small-case alphabetical letters are given,

                         # the length of given string. So we can think space is O(1).

# To solve this problem,
