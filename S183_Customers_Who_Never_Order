Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.
Table: Orders.

select Name as Customers
from Customers
left join Orders
on Customers.Id = Orders.CustomerId
where Orders.CustomerId is NULL

select Name as Customers
from Customers
where Customers.Id not in (select CustomerId from Orders)
